# ASSIGNMENT 1
# After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:
#
# Day 1 - Python Print Function
# The function is declared like this:
# print('what to print')
# print('Day 1 - Python Print Function','The function is declared like this:',"print('what to print')",sep='\n')

# ASSIGNMENT 2
# print("\n\n\n")
# Day 1 - String Manipulation
# String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
# e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
# New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

# print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
# print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# ASSIGNMENT 3
#Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name.
# You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
#Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.
        #Example Input
        #Angela


# l=input('what is your name?')
# print(len(l))
#
# print( len( input("What is your name? ") ) )

#ASSIGNMENT 4

# Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.
# Example Input
# a: 3
# b: 5
# Example Output
# a: 5
# b: 3

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
