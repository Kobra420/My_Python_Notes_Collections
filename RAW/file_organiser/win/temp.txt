Need improvements for the above code :-
# Create sub-folders based on file size ranges like these (from 0 MB to 15MB), (from 15 MB to 200 MB) and (from 200 MB to 4000 MB)
# make subfolder path based on specified target folder path
# write file names only and file sizes only and in Mega Bytes (MB) only in the output file
# write directory path first in the output file then write total directory size in Giga Bytes (GB)
# then write sub-folder paths in the output file along with each subfolder sizes
# write the output file in excel data sheet xlsx format
